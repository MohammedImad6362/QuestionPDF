Although the Judicial Commissioner's Court functioning at those times in Union territory was given certain powers of a High Court under the provisions of the Goa, Daman and Diu (judicial Commissioner's Court) Regulation, 1963, it was not a full-fledged High Court. The Judicial Commissioner also did not enjoy those constitutional safeguards which protect the independence of a High Court Judge. It was further felt that the extension of jurisdiction of a High court to the Union Territory including Goa would improve the tone of judicial administration in these Union territories and would inspire greater public confidence. Under those circumstance, jurisdiction of High Court of Judicature at Bombay was extended to the State of Goa and Union territories of Daman and Diu and Court of the Judicial Commissioner was abolished and a permanent bench of High Court of Judicature at Bombay is established at Panaji (Goa) on 30th October, 1982 as per the provisions of The High Court at Bombay (Extension of Jurisdiction to Goa, Daman and Diu ) Act, 1981."

Although the state invoked its authority under Article 31, a noted Indian jurist, Nanabhoy Palkhivala, convinced the Swami into fighting his petition under Article 26 (not Article 29), concerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference. Even though the hearings consumed five months, the outcome would profoundly affect India's democratic processes."

The remedy can be sought by the prisoner or by another person coming to the prisoner's aid. This right originated in the English legal system, and is now available in many nations. It has historically been an important legal instrument safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary state action."

The concept also holds that the legislative body may change or repeal any previous legislation, and so that it is not bound by written law (in some cases, even a constitution) or by precedent.

The principle of habeas corpus ensures that a prisoner can be released from unlawful detention—that is, detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. The remedy can be sought by the prisoner or by another person coming to the prisoner's aid. This right originated in the English legal system, and is now available in many nations. It has historically been an important legal instrument safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary state action."

Judicial Review refers that the Constitution is the supreme power of the nation and all laws are under its supremacy. Article 13 states that: All pre-constitutional laws, if in part or completely in conflict with the Constitution, shall have all conflicting provisions deemed ineffective until an amendment to the Constitution ends the conflict. In such situation the provision of that law will again come into force, if it is compatible with the constitution as amended. This is called the Doctrine of Eclipse.<br>In a similar manner, laws made after adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly must be compatible with the constitution, otherwise the laws and amendments will be deemed to be void ab initio.<br>In such situations, the Supreme Court or High Court interprets the laws to decide if they are in conformity with the Constitution. If such an interpretation is not possible because of inconsistency, and where a separation is possible, the provision that is inconsistent with constitution is considered to be void. In addition to article 13, articles 32,226 and 227 provide a constitutional basis to judicial review in India."
