This supersedes the right of citizens to be governed under different personal laws based on their religion or caste or tribe. Such codes are in place in most modern nations. The common areas covered by a civil code include laws related to acquisition and administration of property, marriage, divorce and adoption. The Constitution of India attempts to set a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle, or a goal to be achieved."

The amendment also exempted any law giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy from judicial review, even if it violated the Fundamental Rights."
