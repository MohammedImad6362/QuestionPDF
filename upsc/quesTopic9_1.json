This clause was incorporated in the Rule Book on December 5, 2001. Obviously, the intention was to skirt around the necessity of moving and adopting a motion for suspension. Hence Statement 1 is INCORRECT. While the Speaker is empowered to place a member under suspension, the authority for revocation of this order is not vested in her. It is for the House, if it so desires, to resolve on a motion to revoke the suspension. Statement 2: The Chairman may “name a member who disregards the authority of the Chair or abuses the rules of the Council by persistently and wilfully obstructing” business. In such a situation, the House may adopt a motion suspending the member from the service of the House for a period not exceeding the remainder of the session. The House may, however, by another motion, terminate the suspension. Unlike the Speaker, the Rajya Sabha Chairman does not have the power to suspend a member. Hence Statement 2 is INCORRECT."

Consequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only members of Parliament should play their part, but the members of the state legislatures should have a voice.But, when we come to the Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the council of states. It is only on a rareoccasion,and that too for a temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the duties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary that the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to take part in the election of the Vice-President”. Hence Both A and R are individually true. As per the above text, The assertion [EFFECT] is “The electoral college of the Vice-President does not include the members of the State Legislative assemblies” The reason [CAUSE] is “normal function of the Vice-President is to preside over the council of states” In the question, it is given the other way. So, R in the question is not a correct explanation of A. Hence, the answer is B."

Any money received by the government which is not taxation, and is not to be retained by the receiving department (for example, fines), is classed as a Consolidated Fund Extra Receipt (CFER). These are to be paid into the Consolidated Fund as soon as they are received."
