A front load washing machine gets by with so little water because as it turns on, the clothes fall down into the water and are cleaned by the friction created by the wet clothes rubbing together.

The impeachment bill has to be passed by majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the House {special majority}. Once passed in that house, the bill reaches to another house, which shall investigate the charges. President has right to appear and be represented in case of such investigations. If other house also sustains those charges, then it would again need to pass the bill by special majority and thus president stands removed from the office on which the bill is passed in other house.
