Forty-second Amendment of the 42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976) made it explicit that the President shall, \"act in accordance with such advice\". The amendment went into effect from 3 January, 1977. The 44th Amendment (1978) however added that the President can send the advice back for reconsideration once. But if the Council of Ministers sends the same advice again to the President then the President must accept it. The amendment went into effect from 20 June, 1979."

According to the scheme if you are already a Person of Indian origin (POI) and have taken up citizenship abroad, you can take up benefits ofOCI scheme, which gives you the same travel and residence privileges like other Indians but you are not allowed to vote and take up jobs in Government sector."
