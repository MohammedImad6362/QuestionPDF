In case of conflict between the law of the state and union law on a subject in the Concurrent list, the law of the Parliament prevails. Residuary powers rest with the Union government. Parliament can also legislate on subjects in the State list, if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by two-thirds majority that it is necessary to do so in the national interest. During times of emergency, Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State list. Under Article 356 relating to the failure of constitutional machinery in the state, Parliament can take over the legislative authority of the state. Likewise, for the implementation of international treaties or agreements, Parliament can legislate on state subjects. Finally, Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State list if two or more states make a joint request to it to do so. Thus, the centre enjoys more extensive powers than the states."

Article 258 (power of the Union to confer powers etc on states in certain cases) provides a tool by the liberal use of which cooperative federalism can be substantially realised in the working of the system. A more generous use of this tool should be made than has hitherto been done, for progressive decentralisation of powers to the governments of the states.”On Article 356, it was recommended that it be used “very sparingly, in extreme cases, as a measure of last resort, when all other alternatives fail to prevent or rectify a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state."
